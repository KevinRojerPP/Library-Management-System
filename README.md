# Library Management System Assignment
Build a simple Python library management system without OOP. Manage books (add, borrow, return) with basic authentication. Focus on fundamental concepts - variables, loops, conditionals.

## Objective
The objective of this Python assignment is to build a simple library management system using Python's basic modules and functionalities. The program will enable users to perform basic library tasks such as adding books, viewing available books, borrowing books, and returning books. The assignment will focus on fundamental concepts in Python such as variables, data structures, conditional statements, loops, and functions.

## Features and Functionalities
1. Display the list of available books in the library.
2. Add new books to the library.
3. Allow users to borrow books from the library.
4. Allow users to return books to the library.
5. Show user-friendly messages for successful operations and handle possible errors.

## Instructions
1. Use Python >= 3.10 to write the program.
2. Do not use object-oriented programming concepts (classes, inheritance, etc.).
3. Use appropriate data structures like lists and dictionaries to manage the library's book records.
4. Include error handling to manage edge cases like book not found, incorrect input, etc.
5. Create a separate file for the library data (e.g., library_data.py) that will contain the initial list of books.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the project as a ZIP file.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.10 installed on your system.

## Usage
1. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
2. Run the following command to start the library management system:
    ```
    python library_management.py
    ```
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the program.
